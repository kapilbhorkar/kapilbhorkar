It is of vital importance to undertsand the biocompatibility of nano-materials. As a part of collaborative work with SOLUTION ITN partner at Burgos, Spain, we try to relate the  chemical composition, morphology and dimenssion of novel 2D materials with nanotoxicity. I particularly worked with Raman spectrosocpy, XPS and SEM characterise and support the toxicity results.
