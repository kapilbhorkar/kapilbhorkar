Kapil Bhorkar is a Marie Skłodowska Curie doctoral fellow! His doctoral hesis is centered around 2D materials synthesis and incorporating them for harvesting environmental energy (light, water, wind and ambient vibrations) and self-powered sensing. His core expertise is novel industrially viable synthesis techniques (chemicalvapor deposition and laser assisted growth) for graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides.
